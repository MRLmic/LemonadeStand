# Lemonade Stand

This project was completed as part of an interview process. I wanted to utilize up-to-date React hooks and .NET Core. 

*Formally hosted on Azure, this project has been taken down. 

## UI Requirements 
In addition to the below specifications, it was also requested that I reproduce a provided UI mock-up.
